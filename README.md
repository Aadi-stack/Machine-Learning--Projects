# Problem Statement:

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up its manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?
How well do those variables describe the price of a car?
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.

# Business Goal:

we are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with respect to the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc. to meet certain price levels. The model will act as a better medium for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

The following steps will be followed to reach our goal:

1. Importing libraries
2. Reading the concerned dataset
3. Data Understanding
4. Data handling
5. Data visualization
6. Data Preparation
7. Splitting the Data and feature scaling
8. Building a linear regression model
9. Residual analysis of the train data
10. Making Predictions Using the Final Model
11. Model Evaluation
12. Conclusion

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol

# Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

# Steps included in this project:

Importing Lib
Loading Data
Understanding Data
Missing Values
Exploring Variables(Data Analysis)
Feature Selection
The proportion of Good vs Bad Wines
Preparing Data for Modelling
Applying different models
Choosing right model
Hurray you just completed the task!
